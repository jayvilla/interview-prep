/* Imagine you landed a new job as a cashier...

YOur quirky boss foudn out that you're a programmer and has a weird request about
something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:
  1. an amount of money
  2. a list of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available
denominations

Example: for amount=4(4c) and denominations=[1, 2, 3](1C, 2C, and 3C) your program
would output 4-the number of ways to make 4c with those denominations

  1. 1c, 1c, 1c, 1c
  2. 1c, 1c, 2c
  3. 1c, 3c
  4. 2c, 2c */

  const makingChanges = (amount, denominations) => {
    /* todo */
  };

  const exampleAmount = 4;
  const exampleDenominations = [1, 2, 3];

  console.log(makingChanges(exampleAmount, exampleDenominations));
